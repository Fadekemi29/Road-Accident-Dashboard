## Problem Statement
Road accidents remain a critical public safety concern, with multiple factors such as weather conditions, road surface conditions, speed limits, and traffic controls influencing accident severity.
However, raw accident data often exists in unstructured formats, making it difficult for stakeholders to derive actionable insights.
Hence, this project was initiated to perform data cleaning, statistical analysis, and create a dynamic dashboard using Microsoft Excel for better understanding and improved decision-making.

## Rationale for the project
•	Importance of Analyzing Road Traffic Accidents
•	Need for Data-Driven Decision Making 
•	Addressing Key Road Safety Challenges 
•	Enhanced Road Safety Policies 
•	Optimized Resource Allocation


## Tools Used
•	Microsoft Excel – Primary tool for data cleaning, analysis, pivot tables, and dashboard creation
•	Excel Formulas & Functions – For aggregation and statistical summaries
•	Pivot Tables & Charts – For dynamic filtering and visualization
•	Conditional Formatting & Slicers – For interactive dashboard elements

## Specific Objectives of the project
•	To Clean and Standardize the Accident Dataset
•	To Analyze the Frequency and Severity of Accidents
•	To Identify High-Risk Factors Contributing to Accidents
•	To perform Descriptive Statistical Analysis
•	To Develop an Interactive Excel Dashboard for Data Visualization
•	To Provide Data-Driven Recommendations for Road Safety Improvements

## Key Findings
•	Casualties: 2021 recorded over 21,000 casualties, 2022 saw ~7,000 fewer
•	Monthly Trends: Accidents peaked in October–November, declined in December
•	Day of Week: Friday saw the highest accident count
•	Severity: 3% of accidents were fatal, 80% resulted in slight injuries
•	Speed Zones: Over 50% of casualties occurred in 30 mph zones
•	Weather Conditions: Most casualties (~330K) occurred during fine weather with no wind
•	Time of Day: Morning and afternoon had the highest accident occurrences
•	Urban Areas: Accounted for 61% of total casualties

## Statistical Summary:
•	Mean casualties per incident: 1.36
•	Median & Mode: 1 casualty
•	Range: 1 to 48 casualties per incident
•	Distribution: Strong positive skew, with most accidents being low severity


## Deliverables
•	Cleaned accident dataset (Excel format)
•	Statistical analysis summary
•	Interactive Excel dashboard with slicers and charts
•	Strategic recommendations based on insights

## Recommendations
 ### Traffic Safety Interventions
•	Install speed cameras and signage in 30 mph zones
•	Increase patrol presence on Fridays and during Oct–Nov
•	Use digital roadside signs to address overconfidence during good weather
### Policy Measures
•	Declare accident-prone urban areas as safety zones
•	Adjust speed limits dynamically based on time of day, weather, or congestion
### Infrastructure Improvements
•	Add roundabouts or protected turn lanes in hotspots
•	Improve visibility during morning and late afternoon
•	Install pedestrian crossings and raised side walks
### Public Awareness Campaigns
•	Educate drivers about risks of overconfidence in good weather
•	Use radio/social media messaging during peak hours
•	Launch seasonal campaigns starting in September

## Key Takeaway
•	Most accidents involve a single casualty
•	A few rare but severe incidents skew the data
•	Policy and infrastructure strategies must address both frequent minor incidents and occasional high-impact ones

## Future Improvements
•	Incorporate geospatial mapping using Excel or external tools
•	Connect with live traffic or weather feeds for dynamic risk assessment
•	Use Power BI for a more scalable and web-friendly dashboard solution
